# Final Forest

## Introduction

Welcome to Final Forest! üêøÔ∏è A Real-Time Strategy game about defending the **final forest** from invading lumberjacks. You must protect your central Great Oak Tree from being destroyed, if it is, you lose. You must hire squirrels who will collect nuts from trees. The invaders slowly cut down trees which you don't defend, harming your source of nuts. Use your nuts to buy more squirrels, wolves, or bears who can defend your forest. Click on enemies to send animals to attack them; or send your squirrels into trees to act as turrets shooting enemies. **Delay the inevitable** of the final forest's final stand against deforestation.

## How To Play

### Buying Squirrels and Collecting Nuts ü•ú! 

The game works off a nut based economy. You can see the number of nuts you currently have at the top right of the screen. Nuts are used to buy squirrels, wolves or bears. To buy animals, click on the Great Oak tree in the middle of the forest. An Animal Menu should appear on the left of the screen. Clicking on the different animal buttons will buy and spawn these animals. When squirrels spawn they automatically start collecting nuts from trees and bringing them back to the Great Oak tree.
Wolves and bears will patrol the Great Oak tree. Note they won't start attacking enemies unless you tell them to.

### Sending animals to attack the invaders!

To target specific enemies, click on them and an Enemy Menu should appear. From there there are three buttons to send each type of animal to attack them (yes including your squirrels). If your attacking animal defeats the enemy, and there are others nearby, it will try to attack them too.

### Sending your squirrels into trees to shoot at enemies

Click on a tree. A Turret Menu should appear on the left on the screen. Here there are buttons to assign or unassign squirrels from the tree. When a squirrel is assigned to a tree it will walk over to the tree, get in, and start shooting nuts at nearby enemies. You can assign multiple squirrels to a tree and this will increase the fire rate of the squirrel tree turret.

**Have Fun Playing!**

*The game works on the Nintendo Switch too!*
